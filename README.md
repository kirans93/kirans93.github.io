# 🌐 Portfolio — Kiran S

*A clean, fast, developer-focused personal portfolio built with HTML, CSS & JavaScript.*

## 🚀 Overview

This portfolio showcases my backend development work, technical skills, real-world projects, and learning journey. It’s intentionally simple — no heavy frameworks — just clean structure, responsive design, and smooth UX.

The goal: make it easy for recruiters and engineers to understand **what I can do**, **how I think**, and **how I approach backend engineering.**
